# Boston Housing Price Prediction üèòÔ∏èüí°
This project demonstrates a **machine learning** model built to predict housing prices using the **Boston Housing Dataset**. Leveraging _Python_, _Pandas_, and _Scikit-Learn_, the project showcases the process of preparing data, training a regression model, and making predictions.

## Key Features:
- **Data Exploration:** Loaded the Boston Housing dataset and performed initial data analysis, examining features like crime rate, number of rooms, and proximity to amenities.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created a clean data frame of features, including important housing attributes.
- **Model Training:** Trained a machine learning model using regression algorithms to predict housing prices based on the provided data.
- **Prediction Output:** Generated predictions for housing prices using the trained model.

This project highlights essential machine learning techniques, from data preprocessing to model evaluation. Explore the [code](ShapeAI_Python_Machine_Learning/data_prediction.ipynb) to learn more about the prediction process and try it out with different datasets!
